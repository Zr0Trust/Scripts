This repo is for various python scripts as I create them. I will add short descriptions below.

#passwordgenerator.py
This is a a script that will generate a password based on the "password strength" you enter.

#createuser.py
This is a script that will create a user in kali linux, generate a random 15 charachter password and assign the user root privleges if you request them.
